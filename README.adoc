= opentransport-mbedtls

This is a port of just enough of mbedtls to work for libssh, for use by [ssheven](https://github.com/cy384/ssheven).

see https://tls.mbed.org/kb/how-to/how-do-i-port-mbed-tls-to-a-new-environment-OS

== entropy
The classic Mac OS doesn't provide a real RNG.  This code uses a few different sources, including timers, disk usage, mouse position, etc., which are not great, but better options don't seem to exist.
